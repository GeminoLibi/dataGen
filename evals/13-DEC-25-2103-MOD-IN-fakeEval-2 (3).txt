Case ID: CASE-695647
Crime Type: Fraud (Tech Support/Phone Scam)
Complexity: High
Strengths
Entity Consistency (Partial): The victim (James Mcgee) is consistently referenced across documents, with matching DOB and address [1]. The suspect, Gregory Jenkins, is named in both the incident report and the DA discovery index [2].
Timeline Consistency: The core incident timeline (Dec 4, 2025, early morning) is generally consistent across the initial report, CAD logs, and incident report [3].
Crime-Type Appropriateness: The investigation focuses on digital and financial evidence (phone records, DNS/IP, bank records), which is appropriate for a phone scam/fraud case [4].
Investigation Flow: Logical progression from victim statement → phone records → digital forensics → financial analysis → warrant application [5].
Document Structure & Professional Tone: Most documents use realistic law enforcement formats and language (incident report, CAD, DA index, evidence log) [6].
Technical Accuracy: Forensic extraction report includes realistic phone metadata, hashes, and cell tower logs [7].
Hidden Gems/Patterns: Subtle clues are present—e.g., burner phone purchase receipt [8], forensic phone data with contacts and temporal/cell tower patterns [7], and predictive policing data highlighting fraud risk in the target zone [9].
Investigation Quality: Chain of custody for digital evidence is documented, and cross-jurisdictional coordination is recommended [10].
Complexity: Multiple burner numbers, digital forensics, and a suspect vehicle tie-in create a sophisticated, multi-layered case.
Issues Found
Inconsistent Phone Numbers for Suspect Contact
The initial victim report lists the scam call as coming from +1-268-200-7734x476, but the phone records investigation focuses on 7709030859 as the subject number, and the incident report narrative references a text at 02:35 but does not clarify which number was used for the scam call.
Severity: Major
Type: Consistency

Location/Incident Confusion
The victim’s address is in Salazarbury, OK [11], but the incident and CAD reports place the event at 893 Donald Valleys, New Gabriellatown, UT [12]. There is no explanation for why the victim is at this address at 4:21 AM.
Severity: Major
Type: Consistency/Realism
Location: [doc_001_INITIAL_VICTIM_REPORT, doc_005_COMPUTER_AIDED_DISPATCH_CAD_IN, doc_006_INCIDENT_REPORT]
911 Call Data Anomalies
The 911 transcript lists the call as received at 2025-12-13 15:21:12, which is nine days after the incident date (Dec 4). The ANI/ALI data and caller phone numbers also do not match the victim’s number or standard formats. The transcript content is generic and does not clearly relate to the fraud incident.
Severity: Major
Type: Consistency/Technical
Location: [doc_004_911_DISPATCH_TRANSCRIPT]
Physical Evidence Collection in Non-Physical Crime
The evidence log lists a “Suspect Mobile Phone (Seized later)” as collected and sealed, but the narrative does not explain how/when this phone was obtained, nor does it clearly tie the phone to the suspect (Gregory Jenkins). For a phone scam, physical seizure of a phone is plausible if the suspect is apprehended, but the chain of events is unclear.
Severity: Minor
Type: Evidence Chain/Realism
Location: [doc_008_EVIDENCE_COLLECTION_&_PACKAGIN, doc_011_BURNER_PHONE_FORENSIC_EXTRACTI]
Suspect Identity and Motivation
The incident report claims the suspect is Gregory Jenkins, motivated by business failure, but other documents say the suspect’s identity is still under investigation as of Dec 9 [5]. The DA index (Dec 13) lists Jenkins as defendant, but the timeline for identification is not clear.
Severity: Minor
Type: Timeline Consistency/Narrative
Location: [doc_006_INCIDENT_REPORT, doc_003_FOLLOWUP_INVESTIGATION_REPORT, doc_021_DISTRICT_ATTORNEY_DISCOVERY_IN]
Junk Data/Noise
The bank CSV [13] contains only a single, old transaction (2023-01-01), which is not relevant to the case. The inclusion is realistic as noise, but its lack of context may confuse investigators.
Severity: Minor
Type: Junk Data/Signal-to-Noise
Location: [doc_007_BANK_CSV]
CAD/Dispatch Gender Mismatch
The CAD report describes the caller as “FEMALE, HYSTERICAL,” but the victim is male (James Mcgee). No explanation for this discrepancy is provided.
Severity: Minor
Type: Consistency/Realism
Location: [doc_005_COMPUTER_AIDED_DISPATCH_CAD_IN]
Weather Data Discrepancies
The incident report weather is “Clear, 70F” [14], but the weather service for the region on Dec 4 is “Clear, 62F” [15]. This is a minor but notable inconsistency.
Severity: Minor
Type: Consistency/Technical

Consistency Score: 7/10
Entity consistency: 7/10 (main entities consistent, but phone numbers and gender references are inconsistent)
Timeline consistency: 6/10 (main sequence is logical, but 911 call and suspect ID timing are off)

Evidence chain: 7/10 (digital evidence chain is good, but physical phone seizure is not clearly explained)
Realism Score: 8/10
Document structure: 9/10 (realistic formats)
Language/tone: 9/10 (professional, appropriate)

Recommendations
Clarify Phone Number Usage: Ensure the scam call number is consistent across all reports and clearly tie the phone records investigation to the number used to contact the victim.
Explain Victim Location: Add a brief note explaining why the victim was at the incident address (893 Donald Valleys, New Gabriellatown, UT) at the time of the report.
911 Call Consistency: Align the 911 call timestamp and content with the incident timeline and ensure caller identity matches the victim.
Physical Evidence Chain: Explicitly document how/when the suspect’s phone was seized and tie it to the suspect’s apprehension or scene.
Suspect Identification Timeline: Clarify when and how Gregory Jenkins was identified as the suspect, especially in relation to the “identity under investigation” statements.
Junk Data Context: If including unrelated bank data, consider a brief note in the investigative file explaining its irrelevance or why it was included.
CAD Gender Discrepancy: Either explain the gender mismatch (e.g., third-party caller) or correct it for consistency.
Weather Data Alignment: Minor, but align weather data across reports for added realism.
Summary:
This case file demonstrates strong procedural realism, appropriate evidence types, and a complex, multi-layered investigation with hidden patterns and subtle connections. The main issues are inconsistencies in phone numbers, incident location, and minor timeline/gender mismatches. With minor adjustments, this would be an excellent high-complexity training case for AI analysis.
