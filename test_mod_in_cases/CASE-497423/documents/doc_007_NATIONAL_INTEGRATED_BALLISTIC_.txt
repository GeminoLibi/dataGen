================================================================================
CONCLUSION AND OPINION
================================================================================

OPINION: The microscopic examination and digital comparison analysis reveals
that the cartridge case submitted as evidence (NIBIN ID: b774bbb8-9127-41e1-8c0e-db9356bc2ad4) was fired
from the submitted suspect firearm (NIBIN ID: aaff6b86-a24e-426b-bd3f-60d36589159f).

This identification is based on the agreement of all discernible class and
individual microscopic characteristics between the evidence cartridge case
and the test fires from the suspect firearm.

The probability that this cartridge case could have been fired from another
firearm of similar class characteristics is extremely remote.

================================================================================
EVIDENTIARY VALUE ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

This identification provides strong scientific evidence linking the suspect
firearm to the crime scene. The match is based on multiple independent
ballistic signatures and has been verified through independent examination.

REPORT STATUS: FINAL
