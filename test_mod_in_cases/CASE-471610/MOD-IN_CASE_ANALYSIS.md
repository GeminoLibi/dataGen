# WORKING THEORY

## Current Working Theory

Based on my review of the evidence and investigative documents, I believe that 
Dylan Franklin is the primary subject in this assault case. 
The subject's motive appears to be revenge. 
Evidence supporting this theory includes fingerprint evidence, ballistic analysis, phone records, surveillance footage. 
The method of operation suggests 
the use of a weapon. 
Additionally, 2 other subject(s) may be involved: 
Meagan Dillon, Jeffrey Juarez. 

## Confidence Level

I have **moderate confidence** in this working theory. Additional investigation 
is needed to strengthen the case.

## Alternative Theories

I am also considering the following alternative explanations:

- The incident may have involved additional unknown subjects
- There may be mitigating circumstances not yet discovered
- The evidence may point to a different sequence of events than initially believed
