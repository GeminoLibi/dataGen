# WORKING THEORY

## Current Working Theory

Based on my review of the evidence and investigative documents, I believe that 
Dale Maldonado is the primary subject in this assault case. 
The subject's motive appears to be alcohol-fueled. 
Evidence supporting this theory includes fingerprint evidence, ballistic analysis, phone records, surveillance footage. 
The method of operation suggests 
a calculated approach to the crime. 
Additionally, 2 other subject(s) may be involved: 
Derrick Garcia, Melissa Castaneda. 

## Confidence Level

I have **moderate confidence** in this working theory. Additional investigation 
is needed to strengthen the case.

## Alternative Theories

I am also considering the following alternative explanations:

- The incident may have involved additional unknown subjects
- There may be mitigating circumstances not yet discovered
- The evidence may point to a different sequence of events than initially believed
